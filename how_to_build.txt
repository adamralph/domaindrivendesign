How to build DomainDrivenDesign
==================

*NOTE* These instructions are *only* for building with Rake - if you just want to build DomainDrivenDesign manually you can do so just by loading the solution into Visual Studio and pressing build :-)

Prerequisites
-------------

1. Download and install Ruby 1.8.7+ from http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads
2. At the command prompt run the following to update RubyGems to the latest version: 

	gem update --system

3. You will need the albacore gem, install this at the command prompt with:

	gem install albacore

If you have already installed albacore, please update to the lastest version (0.2.6+):

	gem update albacore


Building DomainDrivenDesign
--------------

1. At the command prompt, navigate to the DomainDrivenDesign src folder (should contain rakefile.rb)
2. To run the default build (which will compile, test and package DomainDrivenDesign) type the following command:

	rake

In addition, you can see the full list of all the build tasks by running:

	rake -T

To run a particular task ('spec' for example), use the following command:

	rake spec

You can run multiple tasks by listing them ('test' then 'nuget' for example):

	rake spec nugetpack

After the build has completed, there will be a new folder in the src folder called "bin" containing the build artifacts.
